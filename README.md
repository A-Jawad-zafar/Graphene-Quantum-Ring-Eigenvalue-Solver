# Graphene Quantum Ring Eigenvalue Solver

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that numerically solve the eigenvalue equation of a graphene quantum ring using the Dirac effective model. It focuses on solutions exhibiting physical significance by filtering out those with asymptotic behavior.

## Description

The main script, `GrapheneQuantumRingSolver.m`, employs the bisection method to find solutions where the function changes its sign and can handle different radii values. The purpose is to retain only the physical solutions of the equation and provide insights into the quantum properties of graphene rings.

## Repository Structure

- `GrapheneQuantumRingSolver.m`: The main MATLAB script that initializes the parameters and runs the simulation.
- `Solution.m`: Contains function definitions and performs calculations to find the energy levels near the K-Valley of the Graphene Quantum Ring.
- `asymptotes.m`: A helper function to find the asymptotes in the positive and negative regions.
- `zero_crossings.m`: Computes all values of zero crossing of the Eigenvalue Equation at given input parameters.

## Usage
